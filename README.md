# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Description

*NOTE: Complete your solutions on a whiteboard or on paper first*

For this assignment you will be continuing the logical problems that you were challenged with last night.
* Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns the count of sequences that have consecutive incrementing digits
  * For example:
    * `[1, 0, 3, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 9]` => `[1, [0, 3, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 9]]`
    * There are three sequences, so your function will return `3`

* Consider your solution, and write comments about the Space and Time efficiency in Big-O notation.
  * This should be done as comments

## To Submit this Assignment

* Copy your solution and comments to a new [Gist](http://gist.github.com)
  * Provide a name and description to your file (don't forget to include the file extension)
* Save your Gist as either private or public, and copy the URL.
* Submit the link to your Gist in Canvas along with one observation and any questions.
